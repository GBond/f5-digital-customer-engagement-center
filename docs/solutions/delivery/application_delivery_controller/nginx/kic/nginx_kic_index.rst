Nginx - Kubernetes Ingress Controller
-------------------------------------

NGINX Ingress Controller provides a robust feature set to secure, strengthen, and scale your containerized apps, including:

- Advanced app‑centric configuration – Use role‑based access control (RBAC) and self‑service to set up security guardrails (not gates), so your teams can manage their apps securely and with agility. Enable multi‑tenancy, reusability, simpler configs, and more.
- Visibility and performance monitoring – Pinpoint undesirable behaviors and performance bottlenecks to simplify troubleshooting and make fixes faster.
