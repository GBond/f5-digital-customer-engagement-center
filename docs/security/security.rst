Security
--------

Gartner defines Web Application Firewalls (WAF) as solutions designed to protect web applications and APIs from a variety of attacks, including automated (bots), injection and application-layer denial of service (DoS). WAFs should provide signature-based protections, and should also support positive security models (automated allow lists) and/or anomaly detection.
